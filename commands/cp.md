## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes:

1. Stage all relevant changed files with `git add`
2. Create a single commit with an appropriate message following conventional commits format (feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci)
3. Push the branch to origin
4. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. You MUST do all of the above in a single message. Do not use any other tools or do anything else. Do not send any other text or messages besides these tool calls.
