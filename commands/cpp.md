## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -10`

## Your task

Based on the above changes:

1. Create a new branch if on main
2. Stage all relevant changed files with `git add`
3. Create a single commit with an appropriate message following conventional commits format (feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci)
4. Push the branch to origin
5. Create a **draft** pull request using `gh pr create --draft`
6. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. You MUST do all of the above in a single message. Do not use any other tools or do anything else. Do not send any other text or messages besides these tool calls.
